# Election_Analysis - Module 3 Challenge
##  **Overview**
  This task had us take a good look into election data and to help a client in determining the winner of said election.  The coding language used for this task was python as per the clients instructions.   We also made use of the command prompt and git bash terminals to commit/push and pull files from the projects GitHub repository.  We utilized different data types in python, as well as pulling information from a CSV file.  The results were then printed into the terminal for immediate review as well as printing them to a text file that could be easily accessed by any and all needed parties.  This code could easily be modified to be more generalized for use in any election, not just this one in particular.
